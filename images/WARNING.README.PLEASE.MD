Git sadly is not a viable solution for hosting the OS source code.

This is primarily due to the following:
- Git discards empty folders
- Git has issues with symlinks with absolute values relative to the virtual OS directory<br>
Both of which are unacceptable for this project.

Due to this, the code cannot be hosted here.<br>
The "zipped" versions are available here as the complete .img file useable with LinuxJS.<br>


For the actual source code, I will need to figure out an alternative hosting/version control solution.
